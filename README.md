# CS261 - Group 21:

To run this project, both docker and docker composed are required. Navigate to this folder within command line and simply run
`docker compose build` and `docker compose up`. The initial build is expected to take up several minutes, though anything beyond
10 minutes should be aborted. Additionally, after running docker compose up, the system won't be ready for another few minutes.

The individual status of each container can be seen in the docker desktop application. When they're all green, the containers are running and able to communicate with each other.
